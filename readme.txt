This is an online food portal developed in Java as swing application
The basic idea of the application is that it will search for restuarants according to cuisine and location specified by the user.
It uses Netbeans for front end and MySQL database for backend.
It also uses google static maps in order to show the location of the Hotels located
I have set up proxy connection for this in order to access the google static maps,you can take that off if you're not using any proxy connection
